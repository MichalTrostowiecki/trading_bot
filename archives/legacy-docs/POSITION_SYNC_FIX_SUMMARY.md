# Position Synchronization Fix Summary

## Problem
The research dashboard had a position synchronization issue where:
1. Frontend preloaded extra data before the user's selected start date (e.g., 7 days for M1 timeframe)
2. This caused a mismatch between user position (0 = start date) and data array position
3. Backend and frontend had different understandings of what "position 0" meant
4. Markers were appearing at wrong timestamps due to this offset

## Solution
Implemented a position mapping system that separates user position from data array position:

### Key Changes:

1. **Stored User Start Offset**
   - Added `window.userStartOffset` to store the index where user's selected start date begins
   - User position always starts at 0 (their perspective)
   - Data position = userStartOffset + user position

2. **Updated Position Calculations**
   - `updateChartProgressive()`: Now converts user position to data position
   - `replayAction()`: Uses data position for array access and backend calls
   - `startReplay()`: Auto-play respects user's date range
   - `updatePositionDisplay()`: Shows user position count, not total data count

3. **Fixed Backend Communication**
   - All `/api/backtest/jump/` calls now send data position instead of user position
   - This ensures backend processes the correct bar in the full dataset

4. **Updated UI Display**
   - Position counter shows "1 / userTotal" instead of "1 / totalBars"
   - Progress bar reflects user's selected range
   - Status messages show correct timestamps from data array

5. **Fixed Navigation Limits**
   - "Next" button stops at user's end date, not end of preloaded data
   - "Last" button jumps to last bar in user's range

## Technical Details

### Position Mapping Formula:
```javascript
// User sees: position 0 to (totalBars - userStartOffset - 1)
// Data array: position userStartOffset to (totalBars - 1)
const dataPosition = window.userStartOffset + currentPosition;
```

### Example:
- User selects: Nov 7-8, 2024
- System preloads: Nov 1-8, 2024 (7 days extra for M1)
- userStartOffset = 10,080 (7 days * 1440 bars/day)
- When user is at position 0, data position is 10,080
- This shows Nov 7 data, not Nov 1 data

## Benefits
1. User experience matches expectations (position 0 = their start date)
2. Backend receives correct positions for strategy analysis
3. Markers appear at correct timestamps
4. Navigation controls work within user's selected range
5. Progressive chart display shows correct data progression
