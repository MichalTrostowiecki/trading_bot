 1. Fractal Edge Case Logic: Yes we need a way to manage it, but I'm not too sure what approach would be best.
 2. Swing Direction & Fibonacci Application: Yes that correct.
3. Multiple Timeframe Context: Yes for now we will focus on m1 only but later we will definately test other approaches where we include higher timeframe fractals etc.
4. Entry Triggers: This is not specified as for now I'd be looking for a candle stick pattern. This is why I need to use machine learning to actually find out what would be the best entry trigger.
