Q: Which specific Fibonacci retracement levels do you want to use?
  - Standard levels: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%?
  - Do you use all of them or prefer specific ones?
  - Any custom levels or adjustments?

  Answer: 
   - I think this is also have to be tested which are providing the best results. Usually these are between 38.2 - 78.6 but we would need to have this option to test all levels.

 Q: Do you use Fibonacci extension levels for profit targets?
  - Common extensions: 100%, 127.2%, 161.8%, 261.8%?
  - Which ones do you prefer for Wave 5 targets?
  - Multiple targets or single target?

  Answer:
   - This is exactly what I've been using so far. Again we will have to test it properly. Thats why I need this option to test all levels to find the best one.

Q: Do you enter at multiple Fibonacci levels or focus on one preferred level?
  - For example: Enter at both 38.2% AND 61.8%?
  - Or wait to see which level price respects first?
  - Any priority order for the levels?
  
  Answer:
   - When we will be in a trade we won't open another one. So basically I'm looking to find confluence factors at fibonacci levels for example candle stick pattern, abc type of correction to fib level then we can enter a trade. I would not want to enter a trade just becasue price touched 38.2% and 61.8% as well. I would want to see some confirmation that this is a valid retracement.

Q: How close does price need to be to the exact Fibonacci level?
  - Within 0.1%? 0.5%? 1% of the calculated level?
  - Should this tolerance be fixed or based on volatility (ATR)?

  Answer:
   - This is something we will have to test.

Q: If you do multiple entries, how do you manage them?
  - Same position size for each entry?
  - Scale in with smaller sizes?
  - Independent stop losses or combined?

  Answer:
   - We will only be entering one trade at the time. When in a trade we will have a mode to manage a trade not to look for a trade.

  Q: At what point does a Fibonacci setup become invalid?
  - If price breaks below the swing low (for upward swings)?
  - Time-based invalidation?
  - New dominant swing invalidates old setup?

  Answer:
   - If price breaks below/above swing low/high then we invalidate the setup. As this will mean that the price is not respecting the fib retracement. And most likely we will have new swings.
