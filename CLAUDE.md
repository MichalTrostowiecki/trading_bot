## Project: Fibonacci Trading Bot AI

### Development Workflow Requirements

#### Git Commit Strategy
- **Commit frequently** as we progress through development phases
- Use **conventional commit format**: `type(scope): description`
- Commit after completing each major task or feature
- Examples:
  - `feat(core): implement fractal detection algorithm`
  - `docs(phase1): update data pipeline specifications`
  - `test(fibonacci): add unit tests for retracement calculations`
  - `fix(mt5): resolve connection timeout issues`

#### Documentation Updates
- **Update documentation simultaneously** with code changes
- Keep all specs and guides current with implementation
- Update phase documentation as tasks are completed
- Maintain consistency between code and documentation

#### Project Context
- **SAAS Project**: Proprietary license, not open source
- **Trading Bot**: Fibonacci-based AI trading system
- **Phase-based Development**: Following 7-phase implementation plan
- **Quality Focus**: 90%+ test coverage, comprehensive documentation

#### Key Files to Maintain
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Update with each significant change
- Phase specification documents - Mark tasks as completed
- `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Keep project overview current
- Individual docs in `/docs` - Update as features are implemented

#### Development Principles
1. **Document first, then implement**
2. **Test-driven development**
3. **Commit early and often**
4. **Keep documentation in sync with code**
5. **Follow the phase-by-phase plan**

### Current Project Status
