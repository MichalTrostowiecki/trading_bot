## [2.6.0] - 2025-07-01

### Added
- Comprehensive fractal visualization system with proper TradingView marker management
- Professional FractalMarkerManager class following TradingView Lightweight Charts best practices
- Enhanced debugging system for fractal timing analysis with detailed console logging
- Request throttling system to prevent browser resource exhaustion
- Stale response filtering to ignore outdated backend responses during navigation

### Fixed
- **Critical timestamp mismatch** between frontend chart and backend strategy (4-day discrepancy)
- Backend synchronization by converting absolute data positions to relative positions
- TradingView marker state management preventing fractal disappearance during navigation
- Massive position jumps caused by incorrect currentPosition management in handleBacktestUpdate
- Chart time jumping when clicking next bar through incremental updates instead of full resets
- Fractal arrow directions (red arrows now point up for highs, blue arrows point down for lows)
- ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES browser errors through API call optimization
- Position calculation bugs causing date jumps during navigation

### Changed
- Implemented proper TradingView setMarkers() pattern that preserves all existing markers
- Separated frontend user positions from backend data positions for better synchronization
- Replaced complex marker filtering with clean marker state management
- Enhanced auto-scroll behavior to reduce aggressive chart movement
- Improved progressive data loading to maintain chart stability

### Technical Improvements
- Added proper marker accumulation system that prevents marker loss
- Implemented sequence tracking for async request management
- Added comprehensive fractal timing debugging for development
- Optimized backend call frequency with intelligent throttling
- Enhanced error handling for network resource limitations
