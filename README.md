## 📊 Strategy Overview

### Fibonacci Retracement Continuation Strategy
The core strategy identifies major market swings and enters trades in the direction of the dominant swing using Fibonacci retracement levels:

1. **Fractal Detection**: Identifies swing highs and lows using configurable bars range
2. **Swing Analysis**: Analyzes all recent swings to determine the most dominant one
3. **Dominant Swing Selection**: Uses magnitude, recency, and momentum to select the primary swing
4. **Fibonacci Calculation**: Computes retracement (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%) and extension levels
5. **Continuation Entry**: Enters trades at key retracement levels in the direction of the dominant swing
6. **AI Enhancement**: Machine learning models score signal quality and optimize parameters

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory. Copy the template and modify for your environment:

```bash
copy config\development.yaml.template config\development.yaml
```

Key configuration options:
- MT5 connection settings
- Trading parameters (risk, position sizing)
- Fibonacci levels
- ML model parameters
- Logging and monitoring settings
