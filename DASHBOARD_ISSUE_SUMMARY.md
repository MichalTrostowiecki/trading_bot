# Dashboard Connection Issue Summary

## Current Problem
The research dashboard servers appear to be starting successfully (showing logs like "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9000") but the user cannot access them via browser at http://localhost:9000 or any other port tried (8001, 8002, 8003, 8004, 8080, 8888).

## What Was Working Before
- Research dashboard at http://localhost:9000 was functioning correctly
- Successfully displayed 4 fractals on DJ30 M1 data at correct positions (8, 22, 31, 36)
- User liked the visual style and wanted to update it to match TradingView aesthetic

## What Went Wrong
1. User requested visual styling updates to match TradingView look
2. Instead of just updating CSS in the working dashboard, multiple new files were created:
   - minimal_dashboard.py
   - simple_tradingview_dashboard.py
   - working_dashboard.py
   - test_server.py
3. None of these new servers were accessible via browser
4. Original research dashboard also became inaccessible

## Technical Symptoms
- `curl http://localhost:9000` returns "Connection refused"
- Servers show as running in logs but aren't actually accessible
- No Python processes visible in `ps aux | grep python` after starting servers
- Permission denied errors on some ports (8080)

## Possible Root Causes
1. **WSL Networking Issue**: The servers are binding to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 but WSL may not be forwarding ports correctly to Windows host
2. **Windows Firewall**: Blocking incoming connections to the WSL ports
3. **Port Forwarding**: WSL2 may need explicit port forwarding configuration
4. **Host Binding**: Servers may need to bind to a specific WSL network interface

## Files Created (Need Cleanup)
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/minimal_dashboard.py
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/simple_tradingview_dashboard.py
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/working_dashboard.py
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/test_server.py
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/simple_fractal_test.py

## Original Working Files
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/src/research/dashboard/research_api.py (Main research dashboard - THIS WAS WORKING)
- /mnt/d/trading_bot/launch_research_dashboard.py (Original launcher)

## What Needs to Be Done
1. **Diagnose Connection Issue**: Figure out why servers aren't accessible from browser
2. **Clean Up**: Remove all experimental dashboard files
3. **Restore Working State**: Get original research dashboard working again
4. **Update Visuals Only**: Once working, update ONLY the CSS styling to match TradingView

## User's Explicit Request
"I was asking you not to break anything" - User wanted visual updates only, not architectural changes or new files.

## For Next Session
Start with: "I need help fixing the research dashboard connection issue. The servers start but aren't accessible via browser. This is likely a WSL networking issue. The original dashboard at localhost:9000 was working fine before attempting visual updates."
